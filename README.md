<h2>Define roles and permissions within osTicket: To define roles and permissions within osTicket, log in to the admin panel of your osTicket system. Navigate to the "Admin Panel" and select the "Manage" tab, then click on "Roles." Here, you can create new roles by clicking the "Add New Role" button. For each role, you can define specific permissions, such as access to certain tickets, ability to manage agents, and permission to configure settings. You can customize these permissions based on the role's responsibilities. After defining the roles, assign them to agents by going to the "Staff" section, editing an agent's profile, and selecting the appropriate role from the dropdown. This ensures that users have the appropriate level of access within osTicket.</h2>
